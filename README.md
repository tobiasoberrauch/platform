## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm 9+

### Installation

#### Quick Install (Recommended)

```bash
# Automated installation
make install
```

#### Manual Installation

If you prefer manual installation or the automated script fails:

```bash
# Run the install script directly
./install.sh
```

#### Step-by-step Manual Installation

1. Install Turborepo globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g turbo
   ```

2. Install dependencies for each package:
   ```bash
   # Root dependencies
   npm install turbo @turbo/gen eslint prettier typescript --save-dev

   # UI package
   cd packages/ui
   npm install react @types/react tsup typescript eslint --save-dev

   # Platform app
   cd ../../apps/platform
   npm install next react react-dom @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom typescript eslint eslint-config-next

   # Benchmark app
   cd ../benchmark
   npm install next react react-dom @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom typescript eslint eslint-config-next

   # CSRD app
   cd ../csrd
   npm install next react react-dom @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom typescript eslint eslint-config-next

   # Support app
   cd ../support
   npm install next react react-dom @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom typescript eslint eslint-config-next
   ```

### Development

#### Quick Start

```bash
# Start all applications
make dev
```

#### Configuration

**Port Range (Development):**
```bash
# Default ports: 3000-3003
make dev

# Custom port range: 4000-4003
PORT_RANGE_START=4000 make dev

# Custom port range: 8000-8003
PORT_RANGE_START=8000 make dev
```

**Production Base URL:**
```bash
# Default production URL: https://platform.yourcompany.com
make build

# Custom production URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://app.clevercompany.ai make build
```

#### Individual Apps

```bash
# Start individual applications
make dev-platform     # Platform only
make dev-benchmark    # Benchmark only
make dev-csrd         # CSRD only  
make dev-support      # Support only
```

#### Manual Development

1. **Build shared packages first:**
   ```bash
   cd packages/ui
   npm run build
   # Or use: make build-ui
   ```

2. **Start all applications:**
   ```bash
   # From root directory
   turbo dev
   ```

   Or start individual apps:
   ```bash
   # Platform (main entry)
   cd apps/platform && npm run dev

   # Benchmark
   cd apps/benchmark && npm run dev

   # CSRD
   cd apps/csrd && npm run dev

   # Support
   cd apps/support && npm run dev
   ```
