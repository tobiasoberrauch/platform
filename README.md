## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm 9+

### Installation

#### Quick Install (Recommended)

```bash
# Automated installation
make install
```

#### Manual Installation

If you prefer manual installation or the automated script fails:

```bash
# Run the install script directly
./install.sh
```

#### Step-by-step Manual Installation

1. Install Turborepo globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g turbo
   ```

2. Install dependencies for each package:
   ```bash
   # Root dependencies
   npm install turbo @turbo/gen eslint prettier typescript --save-dev

   # UI package
   cd packages/ui
   npm install react @types/react tsup typescript eslint --save-dev

   # Platform app
   cd ../../apps/platform
   npm install next react react-dom @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom typescript eslint eslint-config-next

   # Benchmark app
   cd ../benchmark
   npm install next react react-dom @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom typescript eslint eslint-config-next

   # CSRD app
   cd ../csrd
   npm install next react react-dom @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom typescript eslint eslint-config-next

   # Support app
   cd ../support
   npm install next react react-dom @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom typescript eslint eslint-config-next
   ```

### Development

#### Quick Start

```bash
# Start all applications
make dev
```

#### Individual Apps

```bash
# Start individual applications
make dev-platform     # Platform only (localhost:3000)
make dev-benchmark    # Benchmark only (localhost:3001)
make dev-csrd         # CSRD only (localhost:3002)
make dev-support      # Support only (localhost:3003)
```

#### Manual Development

1. **Build shared packages first:**
   ```bash
   cd packages/ui
   npm run build
   # Or use: make build-ui
   ```

2. **Start all applications:**
   ```bash
   # From root directory
   turbo dev
   ```

   Or start individual apps:
   ```bash
   # Platform (main entry)
   cd apps/platform && npm run dev

   # Benchmark
   cd apps/benchmark && npm run dev

   # CSRD
   cd apps/csrd && npm run dev

   # Support
   cd apps/support && npm run dev
   ```

### Usage

1. **Start with the Platform** (http://localhost:3000)

## Technology Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 14
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (utility classes)
- **Build System:** Turborepo
- **Package Manager:** npm
- **Linting:** ESLint
- **Formatting:** Prettier

## Project Structure

- **Monorepo:** Turborepo manages multiple apps and packages
- **Shared UI:** Common components in `packages/ui`
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript coverage
- **Modern Design:** Clean, responsive interfaces
- **Cross-navigation:** Seamless product switching

## Product Selector

Each product includes a header navigation that allows users to:
- See current product context
- Switch to any other product
- Return to main platform
- Quick access to all products

The platform serves as the main hub where users can discover and launch products with detailed descriptions and visual cards.

## Development Notes

- All apps share the same UI component library
- TypeScript configuration is shared via `packages/config`
- Each app runs on a different port for parallel development
- Product selector enables seamless navigation between apps
- Modern responsive design with consistent styling
